Soil Moisture Event Week
Flood prediction through H SAF SM products

1. Impact of initial soil moisture conditions on flood simulation

In this exercise we will

run the MISDc rainfall-runoff model over the Tiber River Basin with ERA5 rainfall product
extract the modelled soil moisture data to be compared with satellite-based products (H113 and H27)
perform linear rescaling and filtering to satellite-based products to make them usable for rainfall-runoff simulation
perform flood simulation with different soil moisture initial conditions
All the data are stored in the text file "TEVERE_DATA_NEW.txt".

We will use two satellite-based soil moisture products:

H113 = surface soil moisture data record, based ONLY on satellite soil moisture data from ASCAT
H27 = root-zone soil moisture obtained from the assimilation of ASCAT soil moisture into ECMWF IFS (Integrated Forecasting System)

2. Satellite Soil Moisture for Improving Rainfall through SM2RAIN

In this exercise we will run the MISDc rainfall-runoff model over the Tiber River Basin with different rainfall products as input:

ERA5 reanalysis rainfall
SM2RAIN-ASCAT satellite rainfall obtained from H SAF ASCAT soil moisture
merged rainfall product P-MERG= 0.85 x ERA5+0.15 x SM2RAIN-ASCAT
We will compare the performance of each product to assess the potential benefit of correcting rainfall with satellite soil moisture through SM2RAIN.

All the data are stored in the text file "TEVERE_DATA_NEW.txt".
