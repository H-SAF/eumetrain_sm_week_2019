Soil Moisture Event Week
Drought monitoring through H SAF SM products
In this exercise we will:

extract soil moisture and ERA5 rainfall time-series for the study basin (Tiber river basins)
resample the time-series over the same grid and aggregate the values at monthly time step
Performing some analyses, listed in the following, using soil moisture/rainfall time series and droughts indexes:
Computation of “seasonal” soil moisture
Computation of soil moisture anomalies averaged on the basin
Computation of Standardized Soil Moisture (SSI) drought index: time series averaged on the basin
Comparison of soil moisture (SSI) and precipitation (SPI) based drought indices
Drought in space: maps comparison
We will use two satellite-based soil moisture products:

H113 = surface soil moisture data record, based ONLY on satellite soil moisture data from ASCAT
H27 = root-zone soil moisture obtained from the assimilation of ASCAT soil moisture into ECMWF IFS (integrated Forecasting System)
